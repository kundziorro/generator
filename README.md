## About The Project

Here's the simple app that creates and tracks your currency wallet. The whole project is based on Python 3.8. I have created it to check my skills and use some features in real life, not only with tutorials on the internet ;)

The application is using http://api.nbp.pl to check the actual currency exchange rate and it is only demonstration of my skills. I have never planned to develop this project as a useful application. Please remember it during code review. 

I will appreciate any feedback regarding my code. 

## Getting Started

I highly recommend using an app in Jupyterlab. 

### Installation and usage

To use my code on your own, clone the repository from the following link. 

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mateuszbaranczyk/portfolio.git
   ```
Install required libraries: 

   ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


[Here](https://jupyter.org/install) you can find instructions on how to install and run Jupyterlab. It should be run on a directory with other files from this repo. 

In [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/mateuszbaranczyk/portfolio/blob/portfolio/demo.ipynb) file you can find an example of how the code can be used without downloading and installing anything.
